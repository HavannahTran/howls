        <h2> Introduction </h2> <!-- first section -->
        <p> <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howl%27s_Moving_Castle_(film)">
          Howl’s Moving Castle (2004)</a> is a Studio Ghibli film
          directed by Hayao Miyazaki roughly based on the
          novel by the same name by Dianne Wynne Jones.
          Most of the film occurs in this moving castle owned
          by the titular character, a magical man named Howl.
          Our project is a modeling of one of the rooms in the film at night.

       <h2> Development </h2>
      <p> Here is our <b> <a href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v6m6uK5QB4KcqfWuWchTFChAnRSkypSD63k8EgeR7sA/edit"
        >explicit development plan on Google docs </b> </a>,
        if you'd like to see it.
        First, we created the plain room out of planes.
        We created the illusion of a window and stairs by
        creating these appendages to the room (as seen below). </p>
    <img src =  "images/blankroom.png" alt = "the empty room before we added any components">
    <img src =  "images/appendages.png" alt = "the room from the back showing the appendages for the stairs
    and window">

    <br>
    <p>
    The stairs are a composite object of multiple rectangles.Then we created each of
    the objects in the room:
    the tale, the stool, the chair, the pan on the wall, the spinner,
    the hearth, etc. Each of these, like the stairs is a composite object.</p>

    <img src =  "images/chair.png" alt = "an image of a chair with 4 legs">
    <img src =  "images/pan.png" alt = "a pan hanging off the wall">

    <br>
    <p> The props on the table in particular are composed of
      even more small composite objects, for ease of positioning.</p>

    <img src =  "images/props.png" alt = "an assemblage of different props including
    books, bowls, candle holders, and a bottle">

    <br>
    <p> The ceiling is an amalgamation of many rectangles. </p>

    <img src =  "images/ceiling.png" alt = "a ceiling made of wooden bars">

    <br>
    <p> We added textures to all the objects that needed a little more
      detail such as the carpet, the table, the tapestry, and more. </p>

    <img src =  "images/tapestry.png" alt = "a tapestry with a golden intricate pattern">

    <br>
    <p> We added a plane behind our room with an image of a night sky,
      which could be seen through the transparent window. </p>
